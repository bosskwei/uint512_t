~~ 1. add and sub support ~~
~~ 2. atoi and python support ~~
~~ 3. cpp and python test cases ~~

1. mul and div support
2. refine constructor, and dict input
3. fine sub and support negative (with + - flag)
4. impl += -= *= /=
5. impl mod, mod_inverse, pow, [q, r = (a // b, x % y)]
6. if uint128_add impl cc flag, so that uint256_t could use it
