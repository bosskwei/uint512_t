##

~~1. add and sub support~~  
~~2. atoi and python support~~  
~~3. cpp and python test cases~~  
~~1. mul and div support~~  
~~2. fine sub and support negative (with + - flag)~~  
~~1. refine mulT and mulSubT~~  
~~3. impl += -= *= /=~~  

4. impl mod, mod_inverse, pow, [q, r = (a // b, x % y)]
5. remove some virtual function
6. impl wrapper for python and test


Note:
1. uint128_t += uint128_t, uint128_t -= uint128_t
2. uint128_t = uint128_t +/- uint128_t
3. uint128 *= uint128
4. uint128 = uint128 * uint128
